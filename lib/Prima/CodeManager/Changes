1. added package "package Prima::CodeManager::CodeManager"
with version number for better versions managing.

Now is possible:

use package Prima::CodeManager::CodeManager 0.019

The problem rised because I wanted to put all the modules inside the directory
.../Prima/CodeManager, even the package Prima::CodeManager.

2. Now on $project_color variable is randomly generated from the array @warpColors

3. menuBackColor is synchronized with project_color.

4. changed the order in menu: the Project.

5. added colors (synchronized with the project one) to frames and some other minor
changes in a look.

Added modal feature to this popup. Also added Copy feature.

7. Added saving modified files during closing whole program

8. Added independent encoding for each project

9. Some order changes.

new form:
extensions	= my\w*\.seal$|ini

12. Added the same (#11) - regular expression base mechanism - to
filter directories that have to be displayed.

options:

dir_exclude = \.svn$
ext_exclude =
