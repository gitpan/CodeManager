CodeManager.pm

1. added package "package Prima::CodeManager::CodeManager"
with version number for better versions managing.

Now is possible:

use package Prima::CodeManager::CodeManager 0.19

The problem rised because I wanted to put all the modules inside the directory
.../Prima/CodeManager, even the package Prima::CodeManager.

2. Now on $project_color variable is randomly generated from the array @warpColors

3. menuBackColor is synchronized with project_color.

4. changed the order in menu: the Project.

5. added colors (synchronized with the project one) to frames and some other minor

changes in a look.

6. Added to popup show window the option (Full) Delete and the old one changed into Backup.
Added modal feature to this popup. Also added Copy feature.

File.pm
7. Some order changes.

Notebooks.pm
8. changed the width of edit area and file formating changes.
